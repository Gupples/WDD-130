    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Jared Davey. I'm from Lindon,
        UT, right by Orem and 
        Provo. As you might <br>have guessed,
        I have been a member of the Church my
        entire life. I served in the Omaha 
        Nebraska <br>Mission, speaking Spanish. My major is Software 
        Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy dinking around on the computer/switch in my
        free time. I like Magic the Gathering, 
        Dungeons<br>and Dragons, Genshin Impact, Pokemon,
        Super Smash Bros., anime, and a lot of 
        other nerdy things.
    </p>
    <p>I'm currently single, but I'm hoping to change that soon.
